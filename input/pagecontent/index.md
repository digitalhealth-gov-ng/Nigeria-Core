# Nigeria Core FHIR Implementation Guide

## Purpose
The Nigeria Core Implementation Guide (IG) brings together multiple tracks under a single standards-based framework to demonstrate, test, and advance healthcare interoperability in Nigeria.  
This FHIR IG leveraging HL7 FHIR R4 artifacts so systems can exchange health information seamlessly, securely, and in line with national and international best practices.

---

## Background
Nigeria’s health information ecosystem is often fragmented and siloed. The [**Nigeria Digital in Health Initiative (NDHI)**](https://www.digitalhealth.gov.ng/) of the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (FMoHSW) in collaboration with other health and ICT agencies and regulators, EMR and EHR providers, software developers, insurers, and innovators use this IG to design and test practical standardized and interoperability solutions.  
This IG documents the machine-readable artifacts, profiles, and value sets for the **Health Programes**:

1. Health Insurance & Claims  
2. eCHIS
3. ePharmacy (ePrescription & eDispensing)  
4. Immunization  
5. Medical Devices Communication
6. SON Standards and NDPC Regulation
7. Registries (MDCN and PCN provider and Facility registries)

Each track builds on program datasets, relevant regulatory frameworks, and stakeholder priorities—providing reference implementations for production systems.

---

## Scope of the FHIR Implementation Guide
- Standardize **profiles, value sets, and extensions** for each program  
- Enable **secure interoperable data exchange** across facilities, pharmacies, insurers, referral networks, immunization registries, and device platforms  
- Support **decision-support, regulatory compliance, and real-time data exchange** through open APIs  
- Provide artifacts for **testing and conformance validation** during and beyond the Connectathon

## Connectathon TestScripts (Nine Tracks)

> **Conventions**
> - Prefer **URN UUIDs** for intra-bundle references (e.g., `urn:uuid:...`)  
> - Use IG profiles: `NgPatient`, `NgPractitioner`, `NgProviderOrganization`, `NgPharmacyOrganization`, `NgInsurerOrganization`, etc.  
> - **Transaction** bundles must include `entry.request.method` + `entry.request.url` per entry  
> - Keep examples minimal; warnings are acceptable, **errors are not**

### TestScript 1 — CLAIMS & INSURANCE
**Scenarios:** (i) Eligibility Check, (ii) Pre-Authorization, (iii) Submission & Billing

**Story (summary):**  
“Did you know your hospital bill can travel faster than you can say *‘where is my receipt?’*” In Port Harcourt, night-shift injury becomes a same-day greenlight as the ER nurse runs a digital eligibility check, the clinician requests pre-auth on a tablet, and the cashier submits billing with clean links. A duplicate X-ray is auto-flagged; context is supplied, and approval follows—no phone-tag, no wahala.

**Prerequisites**  
- Profiles installed; shared identifier namespaces  
- Minimal examples prepared for: `NgPatient`, `NgPractitioner`, `NgProviderOrganization`, `NgInsurerOrganization`, `NgCoverage`, `NgCoverageEligibilityRequest/Response`, `NgClaim`, `NgClaimResponse`, `NgInvoice`, `ExplanationOfBenefit`

**Steps**  
A) **Eligibility Check**  
1. POST `NgEligibilityCheck-Request` (transaction): Patient, Provider Practitioner, Provider Org, `CoverageEligibilityRequest`  
2. Expect `NgEligibilityCheck-Response` (collection): `Coverage`, `CoverageEligibilityResponse`

B) **Pre-Authorization**  
3. POST `NgPreAuthorizationBundle` (transaction): Patient, Provider & Insurer Orgs, Coverage, `Claim(use=preauthorization)`  
4. Expect `NgPreAuthorizationBundle` (collection): `ClaimResponse` decision

C) **Submission & Billing**  
5. POST `NgClaim(use=claim)` + optional `NgInvoice`  
6. Expect `ExplanationOfBenefit` (payer result)

**Expected Outcomes**  
- Eligibility outcome present (`inforce=true`)  
- Pre-auth decision returned (`ClaimResponse`) linked to originating `Claim`  
- EOB references submitted `Claim`; totals reconcile with Invoice (if present)

**Validation**  
- Bundle.type correct; all references resolve  
- `Claim.use` values correct across phases  
- `entry.request.*` present for transactions

**Evidence**  
- Request/Response JSON + validator output (0 errors)

**Pitfalls**  
- Missing `entry.request.url` in transactions  
- `Invoice.lineItem.chargeItem[x]` absent (must include `chargeItemReference` or `chargeItemCodeableConcept`)

---

### TestScript 2 — ePHARMACY (ePrescription & eDispensing)

**Story (summary):**  
“In Kano, a patient fills chronic meds without drama.” The pharmacy receives three medication requests, dispenses exact quantities, attaches counseling notes, and issues a simple invoice; payer or patient can later verify line items by dispense references.

**Prerequisites**  
- `NgPatient`, `NgPractitioner` (prescriber & dispenser), `NgPharmacyOrganization`  
- `NgMedication` ×3, `NgMedicationRequest` ×3  
- Response examples: `NgMedicationDispense` ×3, `NgInvoice` (optional)

**Steps**  
1. POST **Prescription Bundle** (transaction): Patient, Prescriber, Pharmacy, Medications, MedicationRequests  
2. POST **Dispense Bundle** (collection): Patient, Pharmacy, Medications, MedicationDispense ×N, optional `NgInvoice`

**Expected Outcomes**  
- `MedicationDispense.authorizingPrescription` links to the right `MedicationRequest`  
- Invoice `lineItem` references dispenses (or uses codeable concepts)

**Validation**  
- Dose/timing present; route present  
- For invoice: at least one `lineItem.chargeItemReference` **or** `chargeItemCodeableConcept`

**Evidence**  
- Request/Response JSON + validator results

**Pitfalls**

### TestScript 3 — MNCH REFERRAL

**Story (summary):**  
“In Lafia, a PHC midwife escalates an ANC case with blood-pressure red flags.” A `ServiceRequest` and initial `Task` notify a secondary hospital; response updates `Task.status`, and tracking confirms arrival and completion—no missed calls, no lost papers.

**Prerequisites**  
- `NgPatient`, `NgPractitioner`, `NgProviderOrganization` (PHC & hospital)  
- `NgServiceRequest`, `NgTask`, optional `Communication`

**Steps**  
1. POST **Referral Initiation** (transaction): Patient, ServiceRequest, Practitioner, Task (`ready`)  
2. Expect **Referral Response** (collection): Task accepted/assigned  
3. POST **Referral Tracking** updates (collection): Task `in-progress` → `completed`

- `Observation.device` → Device; `Observation.subject` → Patient  
- Units present (e.g., mmol/L, bpm)

**Validation**  
- UCUM codes for units where possible  
- Effective times present and recent

**Evidence**  
- Observation JSONs + validator results

**Pitfalls**  
- Missing units or using free text

### TestScript 6 — MDCN USE CASE (Practitioner Registry)

**Story (summary):**  
“In Enugu, a hospital HR verifies a locum doctor before shift.” A practitioner is created/queried against MDCN ID to prevent impersonation and ensure licensure validity.

**Prerequisites**  
- `NgPractitioner` profile; MDCN identifier system agreed

**Steps**  
1. POST `NgPractitioner` with MDCN ID  
2. GET `/Practitioner?identifier=<system>|<value>`

**Expected Outcomes**  
- 201 on create; search returns exact match with correct status

**Validation**  
- Identifier system/code correct; `active = true`

**Evidence**  
- POST/GET payloads + logs

**Pitfalls**  
- Wrong identifier namespace; inactive practitioner used in tests

---

### TestScript 7 — PCN USE CASE (Pharmacy Registry)

**Story (summary):**  
“In Abeokuta, a neon sign is not a license.” A community pharmacy publishes `NgPharmacyOrganization` with PCN number; citizens and HMOs verify registration by identifier. Unlicensed “chemist” shops are filtered out.

**Prerequisites**  
- `NgPharmacyOrganization` profile; PCN identifier system agreed

**Steps**  
1. POST `NgPharmacyOrganization` (active = true; type = pharmacy; PCN identifier)  
2. GET `/Organization?identifier=<system>|<value>`

**Expected Outcomes**  
- Organization retrievable by identifier; type coding present

**Validation**  
- Address/telecom present; canonical org-type used

**Evidence**  
- POST/GET JSON + logs

**Pitfalls**  
- Non-canonical org-type; missing identifier

### TestScript 8 — SON USE CASE (Standards & Consent/Pseudonymization)

**Story (summary):**  
“In Kaduna, a facility implements consent and pseudonymization to share data safely.” A simple consent is recorded; separately, a patient/practitioner/related-person example is pseudonymized for a privacy-preserving flow.

**Prerequisites**  
- `NgConsent` profile + example  
- Pseudonymized `NgPatient`, `NgPractitioner`, `NgRelatedPerson` (consistent tokenization domain)

**Steps**  
1. POST `NgConsent` (opt-in/opt-out per scenario)  
2. POST pseudonymized Patient/Practitioner/RelatedPerson resources

**Expected Outcomes**  
- Consent discoverable and linked to subject  
- Pseudonymized identifiers consistent across resources

**Validation**  
- `Consent.provision.type` set appropriately  
- No direct identifiers in pseudonymized resources

**Evidence**  
- JSON resources + validator logs

**Pitfalls**  
- Mixing real PHI into pseudonymized examples; inconsistent pseudonyms

---

### TestScript 9 — PRIVACY USE CASE (Applied Pseudonymization)

**Story (summary):**  
“In Uyo, a research extract replaces direct identifiers with tokens while preserving clinical utility.” The dataset keeps dates within policy (e.g., month/year only) and retains linkability across encounters with a stable pseudonym.

**Prerequisites**  
- Clear policy for tokenization, date handling, and quasi-identifiers  
- Pseudonymization function documented (salted/HMAC or equivalent)

**Steps**  
1. Transform Patient/Practitioner/RelatedPerson to pseudonymized variants  
2. POST transformed resources  
3. Run sample query chains to confirm linkability (same pseudonym across resources)

**Expected Outcomes**  
- No direct identifiers present  
- Queries still correlate patient across resources

**Validation**  
- Pseudonym fields consistent; addresses generalized where required

**Evidence**  
- Before/after examples; pseudonymization method note

**Pitfalls**  
- Reversible tokens without controls; leaking rare combinations (re-identification risk)

---

## General Validation & Logistics

- **Transport:** Use HTTPS endpoints; include `Content-Type: application/fhir+json`  
- **Bundle Hygiene:**  
  - `transaction` ⇒ each entry has `request.method` + `request.url`  
  - `collection` ⇒ omit `entry.request`  
  - Prefer `urn:uuid:` in `fullUrl` and internal references  
- **Coding:** Use official code systems (THO/HL7, UCUM). Keep custom code systems under your canonical  
- **Evidence Pack:** Submit request/response JSON, validator reports, and brief screenshots as needed  
- **Passing Criteria:** No **errors** in validation; warnings acceptable if justified in notes

---

## Appendix — Quick Tips

- **Invoices:** Each `Invoice.lineItem` must carry **either** `chargeItemReference` (e.g., a `MedicationDispense`/`Procedure`) **or** `chargeItemCodeableConcept`.  
- **Claims:** Keep `Claim.use` appropriate to phase (`preauthorization` vs `claim`).  
- **Devices:** Always include measurement units (UCUM).  
- **Privacy:** When in doubt, **pseudonymize** and briefly document how.  
- **Troubleshooting:** If references don’t resolve, check `fullUrl` vs local `Reference(target-id)` and slice constraints in your bundle profile.
